Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
  
   Google Data Analytics Course capstone project: case study on Cylclistic bike share.The main objective to Design marketing strategies aimed at **converting casual riders into annual members**. For better understanding of casual and annual memebers, customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships(Flexible options) are Cyclistic members. To be specific, a sucessful bike sharing company desires to increase the number of their annual memberships.

I used **R** programming to solve the case study. 
  
 ## Insights:
 1. Member riders are mostly working people, where their usage are high in weekdays compare to weekends.
  
 2. Causal riders prefer for long ride. Because the average duration are higher than memebers.
  
 3. Casual riders usage are high in weekend than weekday.
 
 ## Solution
  1. Increasing the renting price bikes for weekend to target the casual user to get annual memberships.
  
  2. Providing special service for only memebers might motivate casual to have annual membership. These services might include free tour guide, free pass or free renting for 2 months etc.
  
  3. Using Banners in stations to display the discount or offers for membership makes casual riders to get membership.
